# Simple Java Calculator


## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹


**This is a basic calculator built with Java to practice fundamental Java concepts**

## The challenge

- **User Interaction**: The calculator prompts users to input two numbers and choose an arithmetic operation.
- **Basic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also checks for division by zero to prevent errors.
- **Array Operations**: Includes a feature to calculate the average of an array of numbers. Users can specify the number of elements they want to input.
- **Loop Iterations**: Utilizes both for and foreach loops for iterating through arrays and performing calculations.
- **Error Handling**: Provides feedback for invalid operations or inputs.
- **JUnit Testing**: Comes with a separate class for JUnit tests to ensure the reliability of the calculator functions.

## Key Learnings

- **Error Handling**: Ensuring that the calculator can handle unexpected inputs, especially division by zero
- **Single Scanner Limitation**: We learned that having multiple Scanner objects reading from System.in can lead to unexpected behavior. It's best to have a single Scanner instance per class to avoid potential issues.
- **JUnit Testing**: Implementing JUnit tests
- **Collaboration**: Working with a partner highlighted the value of clear communication, code reviews, and collaborative problem-solving.
